1. Run /track username to start tracking stats for a player - this means you obviously cannot track past stats.
2. (optional) Run /claim username to link your discord account to the username, allowing you to run additional commands. This will ask me (Chuckegg) for confirmation, as I don't want 1 person claiming every single tracked account. - running /unclaim will unlink your discord account to the username. 
Your stats will now be tracked constantly, allowing you to view information not tracked by popular bots like HyStats.
Commands:
/sheepwars - shows you the all-time, session, daily, yesterday and monthly stats for a player.
/leaderboard - shows you the all-time, session, daily, yesterday and monthly leaderboard for a specific stat.
/kill-leaderboard - shows you the all-time, session, daily, yesterday and monthly leaderboard of all different types of kills.
/death-leaderboard - shows you the the all-time, session, daily, yesterday and monthly leaderboard of all different types of death.
/prestige - shows what prestige prefix you would have with a specific wool games level.
/prestiges - shows a messed up list of all prestiges
[VERIFIED ONLY]
/reset - resets your session stats (like the hystats bot)
/color - allows you to set a color to your username when it is used inside a bot command like /sheepwars
/unclaim - unlinks your discord account to the specified username
